Pycaret is  a low code implementating machine learning library, which has the capability of handling every single techniques (feature engineering, data preprocessing, feature selection, handling missing values, normalization). It also helps in implementing all maching learning techniques and helps to compare among them that which algorithm yeilds the best result.

## About Dataset
I have implemented Anomaly detection data using this library. This data can be found in-built in pycaret. Anomaly in simple words can be said as an error,flaw or a defect that is detected in the data. Suppose, for banking data it can be fraud detection, for online sectors it can be bad source of advertisement whenervr you click the website etc.
